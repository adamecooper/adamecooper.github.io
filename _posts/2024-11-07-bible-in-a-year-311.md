# The Bible in a Year Podcast: Day 311

### 2 Maccabees 14
- A former disgraced high priest, Alcimus, went to King Demetrius to commit 
treason. He lied to Demetrius, saying that Judas was stirring up sedition. 
He said the kingdom would never be at peace while Judas was alive.
- Demetrius sent Nicanor with orders to kill Judas
- The Jews prayer to God at the coming of Nicanor and rode out to fight 
Nicanor in battle. Nicanor made peace with Judas.
- Alcimus again went to Demetrius to betray Judas, who again ordered Nicanor
to kill Judas.
- Judas sensed the betrayal and went into hiding. Nicanor went to the temple, 
and demanded that the priests hand over Judas even though they didn't know 
where he was. Nicanor threatened to destroy the temple, and so the priests 
prayed to God for salvation.
- Nicanor arrested a pious Jew, Razis, who committed suicide in a dramatic 
fashion, imploring the Lord to raise him up once more.

### Wisdom 17-18

A foretelling of Jesus.
```
For their enemies[h] deserved to be deprived of light and imprisoned in darkness,
those who had kept thy sons imprisoned,
through whom the imperishable light of the law was to be given to the world.
```

```
For a blameless man was quick to act as their champion;
he brought forward the shield of his ministry,
prayer and propitiation by incense;
he withstood the anger and put an end to the disaster,
showing that he was thy servant.
```

### Proverbs 25:18-20

``` 
A man who bears false witness against his neighbor
    is like a war club, or a sword, or a sharp arrow.
 
Trust in a faithless man in time of trouble
    is like a bad tooth or a foot that slips.

He who sings songs to a heavy heart
    is like one who takes off a garment on a cold day,
    and like vinegar on a wound.
```

### Fr Mike Summary
- Life is not a Hallmark movie. God often works through very broken people in a 
messy story (betrayal, thousands of people dead, the story of Razis).
- Here is the way God is present even in scenarios that seem like they're out
of a horror movie. This is also true of our broken lives.
- The "reality" of secret sins. In reality, there is no such thing as a secret 
sin. At the same time, if there's no secret sin, there's also no secret virtue,
even no secret attempt at virtue.
```
For thinking that in their secret sins they were unobserved
behind a dark curtain of forgetfulness,
they were scattered, terribly[a] alarmed,
and appalled by specters.
For not even the inner chamber that held them protected them from fear
```
- The following excerpt talks about the Egyptians conspiring to kill the first
born of the Jewish people, and how they were in darkness due to their sin.
```
For the whole world was illumined with brilliant light,
and was engaged in unhindered work,
while over those men alone heavy night was spread,
an image of the darkness that was destined to receive them;
but still heavier than darkness were they to themselves.
```
- The following excerpt represents the Justice of God, but is also a prophecy of 
the Nativity (the word made flesh).
```
For while gentle silence enveloped all things,
and night in its swift course was now half gone,
thy all-powerful word leaped from heaven, from the royal throne,
into the midst of the land that was doomed,
a stern warrior 16 carrying the sharp sword of thy authentic command,
and stood and filled all things with death,
and touched heaven while standing on the earth.
```
