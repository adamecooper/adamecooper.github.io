# The Bible in a Year Podcast: Day 295

### 1st Maccabees 14
- Demetrius is defeated in battle and Simon gave him a 
nice eulogy
- Rome and Sparta wrote to Simon to renew their alliance after
hearing about Jonathan's death
- The people of Israel wrote a bronze record thanking Simon for 
his great accomplishments. The record gave Simon absolute power
even over all the priests; he became the high priest and king.

### Sirach 34-35
- "Divinations and omens and dreams are folly, and like a woman 
in travail the mind has fancies. Unless they are sent from the 
Most High as a visitation, do not give your mind to them."
- "Like one who kills a son before his fatherâ€™s eyes is the man 
who offers a sacrifice from the property of the poor."
- "Do not offer him a bribe, for he will not accept it". This is 
the impulse to think we can control God as if we're making an
exchange with him. With this mindset, we have a mercenary 
heart.

### Proverbs 23:22-25 
- "Buy truth, and do not sell it; buy wisdom, instruction, and 
understanding."

### Fr Mike Summary
- "Each man sat under his vine and his fig tree, and there 
was none to make them afraid." Israel had rest from its 
enemies (temporarily...)
- At the time, given the military success of the Maccabees, 
the Jews were likely waiting for God to raise up the Messiah 
to conquer the world; in reality, however, the Romans came 
and conquered them. And yet, unexpectedly, from this subjugated 
nation, the King of Kings would arise. God's next steps are 
often not our next steps.
