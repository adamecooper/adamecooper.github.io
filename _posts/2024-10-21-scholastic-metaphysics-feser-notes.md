# Scholastic Metaphysics (Feser) Notes

### Chapter 0: Prolegomenon 

- Scientism is incoherent because it presupposes a belief (i.e. all aspects of reality can be explained by science) which itself cannot be verified by the scientific method.
- The naturalist worldview brackets away everything that cannot be quantified (i.e. all of the qualitative aspects of our conscious experience - qualia) into “the mind”, which it in no way explains. A Cartesian dualism, with all its problems, necessarily follows.
- All of our knowledge of the world comes from our sensory experiences, and scientists abstract those into theories about change (e.g. mechanics); therefore, those theories in principle cannot explain the nature of the sensory experiences used to produce them.
- Bertrand Russell understood that physics explains the abstract structure of the physical world, but not the intrinsic nature of that which has that structure. Physics can explain how matter behaves but not what matter is.
- Science can describe laws of nature but cannot explain what they actually are or why they exist. Scientism is therefore unable to provide an ultimate explanation of reality.
- Scientism is akin to believing that only metal objects exist based on the fact that you’re searching for objects with a metal detector. Or that a spot of the road illuminated by a streetlight is the only place one should look for his lost keys because it’s the only place one believes he has a hope of finding them.
- Metaphysics is prior to epistemology. Propositions about knowledge always rest on metaphysical assumptions.

### Chapter 1: Act and Potency
- Aristotle responds to two extreme positions in his analysis of change. Parmenides believes change is impossible because it involves being arising from non-being while Zeno applies paradoxes (e.g. distances bisected infinitely) to argue that change is impossible. Aristotle counters both extremes by positing that change involves what is (act) actualizing what could be (a potency).
- Aristotles’s distinction between act and potency can also be deployed to counter the belief that there is only one being or everything is a multiplicity of beings. To the first claim, Aristotle responds that things can be defined (and therefore) distinguished by their acts & potencies beyond just the fact that they share a common “being”. To the second claim, Aristotle responds that things can only potentially be divided into infinity many beings, but in actuality this is not the case.
