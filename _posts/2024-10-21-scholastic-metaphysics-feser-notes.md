# Scholastic Metaphysics (Feser) Notes

### Chapter 0: Prolegomenon 

- Scientism is incoherent because it presupposes a belief (i.e. all aspects of reality can be explained by science) which itself cannot be verified by the scientific method.
- The naturalist worldview brackets away everything that cannot be quantified (i.e. all of the qualitative aspects of our conscious experience - qualia) into “the mind”, which it in no way explains. A Cartesian dualism, with all its problems, necessarily follows.
- All of our knowledge of the world comes from our sensory experiences, and scientists abstract those into theories about change (e.g. mechanics); therefore, those theories in principle cannot explain the nature of the sensory experiences used to produce them.
- Bertrand Russell understood that physics explains the abstract structure of the physical world, but not the intrinsic nature of that which has that structure. Physics can explain how matter behaves but not what matter is.
- Science can describe laws of nature but cannot explain what they actually are or why they exist. Scientism is therefore unable to provide an ultimate explanation of reality.
- Scientism is akin to believing that only metal objects exist based on the fact that you’re searching for objects with a metal detector. Or that a spot of the road illuminated by a streetlight is the only place one should look for his lost keys because it’s the only place one believes he has a hope of finding them.
- Metaphysics is prior to epistemology. Propositions about knowledge always rest on metaphysical assumptions.

### Chapter 1: Act and Potency
- Aristotle responds to two extreme positions in his analysis of change. Parmenides believes change is impossible because it involves being arising from non-being while Zeno applies paradoxes (e.g. distances bisected infinitely) to argue that change is impossible. Aristotle counters both extremes by positing that change involves what is (act) actualizing what could be (a potency).
- Aristotles’s distinction between act and potency can also be deployed to counter the belief that there is only one being or everything is a multiplicity of beings. To the first claim, Aristotle responds that things can be defined (and therefore) distinguished by their acts & potencies beyond just the fact that they share a common “being”. To the second claim, Aristotle responds that things can only potentially be divided into infinity many beings, but in actuality this is not the case.
- The success of modern science provides further
justification for the validity of the act-potency 
distinction. This is because science rests on the 
fact that the world consists of studying distinct, 
changing things based on our perceptual experience, 
which also consists of distinct, changing episodes.
- Potenct limits actuality. For example, a rubber 
ball can never perfectly instantiate "roundness" 
since rubber as matter thet can assume other forms 
limits the ball's roundness to only an approximation. 
True roundness can only be achieved jn perfect actuality.
- Act is more fundamental than potency because...
  - Potencies are defined in terms of actualities
  - Potentcies are grounded in their actualities
  - Only actual things can actualize potentials
  - Nothing purely potential can exist
- There are different categories of potencies...
  - Objective potencies (existing merely as objects of 
  thought - e.g. unicorns) vs subjective potentcies 
  (existing within a real subect - e.g. rubber's ability
  to be melted).
  - Active potencies (i.e. powers) vs passive 
  potencies (i.e. true potencies)
  - Natural (e.g. eating or sleeping) vs supernatural 
  potency (e.g. attaining the Beatific vision)
- There are different kinds of acts:
  - Pure act (i.e. God) vs mixed act (i.e. mixed with potency)
  - Operative act vs entitative (essential) act


#### 1.2 Causation
- It's important to distunguish the power from the action
as well as the passive potency from an instance of it
being actualized.
- Potency is what limits causes to the specific range of
effects they have. Only pure actuality can cause all effects.
- To say "opium causes sleep because it has a dormitive power"
is not a tautology because it tells us powers are real, and 
critics of Scholasticism would not agree with that. Powers
establish that causal relations actually exist.
- Physical sciences explain how causes bring about their 
characteristic effects, but scholastic philosophy establishes
the reason there is causality at all.
- metaphysics : chemistry :: powers : vehicles
- Trying to reduce powers to vehicles runs into the same problem
as trying to reduce potencies to act (i.e. the denial of change).
- Ockham denied universals because he put so much emphasis on the 
divine will that he didn’t think anything could limit it (i.e. 
God couldn’t will just anything for something with a universal 
essence). This emphasis on the divine will led Ockham led him to 
reject causation as well because he thought it was always possible 
that God was bringing about some perceived secondary effect.
- Occasionalism is the idea that God causes ALL effects directly
- Scholastics attributed causal powers immanent to matter, and 
explained reality in a “bottom up” manner arising from these 
powers. In contrast, early modernists held that matter was passive 
and their apparent powers were actually imposed from above (i.e. 
a “top down” approach). 
- The Scholastic ideas about causality were hollowed out first 
by Ockham, then Descartes, until causality was completely rejected 
altogether by Hume. Hume’s position is now the default 
philosophical starting point even though there’s no objective 
reason why it should be.
- Humean objections to causal powers can be grouped into 
regularities and counterfactual explanations. Both aim to describe 
cause and effect merely in terms of what happened as opposed to 
any active powers
- Humean regularities have obvious issues (e.g. stone splashing 
sound causing the movement of the leaf) that the counterfactual 
objection is able to handle.
- The electro-fink provides one example where cause and effect 
cannot be explained by counterfactual analysis while it can be 
explained in terms of causal powers.
- Effects can be “polygenic” (resulting from different powers 
working in tandem) and powers can be “pleiotropic” (having several 
different effects).
- Powers working together to manifest different effects helps explain 
how counterfactuals are consequences of powers as opposed to 
constitutive;  often, eliminating 1 power is will prevent the effect 
from manifesting.
- Nancy Cartwright’s arguments from the philosophy of science 
support causal powers. Scientific experiments assume powers exist by 
aiming to control for all other factors except the one being measured.
- Scientists today talk about things as if they had certain powers (e.g. 
a negatively charged particle has the power to attract a positively 
charged particle).
- The fact that a law of nature is a regularity explains nothing. We 
want to understand why a law of nature manifests as it does and not some 
other way and why it even exists at all. Causal powers are explanatory 
because they account for how things are due to their essences.
- Laws presuppose powers. Without either powers or divine decree, laws 
become vacuous or incoherent.

#### 1.3 Real Distinctions?
- Scholastic definitions 
    - real distinctions exist in reality outside of minds
    - logical distinctions reflect different ways of thinking 
      about something
