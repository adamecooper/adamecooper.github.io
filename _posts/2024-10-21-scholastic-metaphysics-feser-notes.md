# Scholastic Metaphysics (Feser) Notes

### Chapter 0: Prolegomenon 

- Scientism is incoherent because it presupposes a belief (i.e. all aspects of reality can be explained by science) which itself cannot be verified by the scientific method.
- The naturalist worldview brackets away everything that cannot be quantified (i.e. all of the qualitative aspects of our conscious experience - qualia) into “the mind”, which it in no way explains. A Cartesian dualism, with all its problems, necessarily follows.
- All of our knowledge of the world comes from our sensory experiences, and scientists abstract those into theories about change (e.g. mechanics); therefore, those theories in principle cannot explain the nature of the sensory experiences used to produce them.
- Bertrand Russell understood that physics explains the abstract structure of the physical world, but not the intrinsic nature of that which has that structure. Physics can explain how matter behaves but not what matter is.
- Science can describe laws of nature but cannot explain what they actually are or why they exist. Scientism is therefore unable to provide an ultimate explanation of reality.
- Scientism is akin to believing that only metal objects exist based on the fact that you’re searching for objects with a metal detector. Or that a spot of the road illuminated by a streetlight is the only place one should look for his lost keys because it’s the only place one believes he has a hope of finding them.
- Metaphysics is prior to epistemology. Propositions about knowledge always rest on metaphysical assumptions.

### Chapter 1: Act and Potency
- Aristotle responds to two extreme positions in his analysis of change. Parmenides believes change is impossible because it involves being arising from non-being while Zeno applies paradoxes (e.g. distances bisected infinitely) to argue that change is impossible. Aristotle counters both extremes by positing that change involves what is (act) actualizing what could be (a potency).
- Aristotles’s distinction between act and potency can also be deployed to counter the belief that there is only one being or everything is a multiplicity of beings. To the first claim, Aristotle responds that things can be defined (and therefore) distinguished by their acts & potencies beyond just the fact that they share a common “being”. To the second claim, Aristotle responds that things can only potentially be divided into infinity many beings, but in actuality this is not the case.
- The success of modern science provides further
justification for the validity of the act-potency 
distinction. This is because science rests on the 
fact that the world consists of studying distinct, 
changing things based on our perceptual experience, 
which also consists of distinct, changing episodes.
- Potenct limits actuality. For example, a rubber 
ball can never perfectly instantiate "roundness" 
since rubber as matter thet can assume other forms 
limits the ball's roundness to only an approximation. 
True roundness can only be achieved jn perfect actuality.
- Act is more fundamental than potency because...
  - Potencies are defined in terms of actualities
  - Potentcies are grounded in their actualities
  - Only actual things can actualize potentials
  - Nothing purely potential can exist
- There are different categories of potencies...
  - Objective potencies (existing merely as objects of 
  thought - e.g. unicorns) vs subjective potentcies 
  (existing within a real subect - e.g. rubber's ability
  to be melted).
  - Active potencies (i.e. powers) vs passive 
  potencies (i.e. true potencies)
  - Natural (e.g. eating or sleeping) vs supernatural 
  potency (e.g. attaining the Beatific vision)
- There are different kinds of acts:
  - Pure act (i.e. God) vs mixed act (i.e. mixed with potency)
  - Operative act vs entitative (essential) act


#### 1.2 Causation
- It's important to distunguish the power from the action
as well as the passive potency from an instance of it
being actualized.
- Potency is what limits causes to the specific range of
effects they have. Only pure actuality can cause all effects.
- To say "opium causes sleep because it has a dormitive power"
is not a tautology because it tells us powers are real, and 
critics of Scholasticism would not agree with that. Powers
establish that causal relations actually exist.
