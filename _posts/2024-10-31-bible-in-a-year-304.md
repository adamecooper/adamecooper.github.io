# The Bible in a Year Podcast: Day 304

### 2 Maccabees 7
- The king was compelling 7 brothers and their mother by torture to eat
swine. They refuse, saying they are ready to die.
- The king tortured and killed each brother gruesomely.
- The second brother indicates that God will resurrect them.
- The fourth brother also hints at the hope of resurrection and that God
will not resurrect the king
- The mother saw her seven sons perish but was courageous because of her 
hope in the Lord. The mother also says God will "give life and breath back to"
her sons
- Antiochus tries to tempt the seventh son with riches, but his mother 
encourages her to accept death and have faith in God, which he does.

```
So he died in his integrity, putting his whole trust in the Lord.
```

- Finally the mother died after her sons

### Wisdom 3-4
- God will take care of the righteous and punish the ungodly
- Wisdom calls out the goodness of faithful men and women that don't have
children and condemns adulterers and those in an unlawful union.

```
Better than this is childlessness with virtue,
for in the memory of virtue is immortality
...
But the prolific brood of the ungodly will be of no use,
and none of their illegitimate seedlings will strike a deep root
or take a firm hold.
```

```
They will come with dread when their sins are reckoned up,
and their lawless deeds will convict them to their face.
```

### Proverbs 24:27-29
```
Do not say, “I will do to him as he has done to me;
    I will pay the man back for what he has done.”
``` 

### Fr Mike Summary
- The witnness of the 7 brothers and their mom is incredible. They were 
uncomprising in their faithfulness to the Lord.
- Maccabees and Wisdom both witness to life after death.
- This world is a gift that God gave us, but we're not ultimately made for this 
world.
- Wisdom 3 talks about our hope as Christians but also the purification process 
we must undergo (i.e. Purgatory)
```
But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God,
and no torment will ever touch them.

In the eyes of the foolish they seemed to have died,
and their departure was thought to be an affliction,
and their going from us to be their destruction;
but they are at peace.
```
- In the Old Testament Jewish culture, barren women and eunuchs were not seen 
to be blessed, but Wisdom 3 explains that this is not true. This is because 
there is more to life than just this life. Better to have a short righteous life 
than a long one filled with sin, or a childless life of righteousness than having 
a bunch of children and being wicked.
