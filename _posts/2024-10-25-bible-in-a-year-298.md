### 2 Maccabees 1
- The Jews in Judaea write a letter to the Jews in Egypt 
telling them to celebrate the Hannukah festival based on 
the miracle of the oil
- A recount of how Nehemiah hid the sacred fire, which 
turned to liquid, and, once it was placed back on the altar
and the sun shone on it, turned back into fire 

### Sirach 40-41
- A wife is a better gift to her husband than a best friend

### Proverbs 24:1-7

### Fr Mike Summary
- Don't think about death as something being taken away from
us; instead appreciate the undeserved gift of life God has
given us. This is true whether someone lives for 1 day or 
100 years
