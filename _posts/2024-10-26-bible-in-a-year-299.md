# The Bible in a Year Podcast: Day 299

### 2 Maccabees 2
- Jeremiah exhorted Jews getting deported to
Egypt not to lose the Law in their heart
- Jeremiah hid the tent, ark, and altar of incense
in a cave where Moses had also been buried, telling 
those that followed him that the place would remain 
unknown until God returned
- The authors of 2 Maccabees explain that they're
not attempting to be exhaustive historians like 1
Maccabees, but retelling the story in a summary 
highlighting where God was during that trying time

### Sirach 42-44
```
Do not be ashamed to instruct the stupid or foolish
    or the aged man who quarrels with the young.
Then you will be truly instructed,
    and will be approved before all men.
```

```
For the Lord has made all things,
    and to the godly he has granted wisdom.
```

### Proverbs 24:8-9
```
He who plans to do evil
    will be called a mischief-maker.

The devising of folly is sin,
    and the scoffer is an abomination to men.
``` 

### Fr Mike Summary
- Let us glorify God in the things we choose to do,
but also the things we choose not to do.
- When Jeremiah hid the ark, it was the last time 
anyone would ever see it (until Revelation chapter 12)
- The temple rebuilt after the Babylonian exile was 
empty in a way due to the absence of the ark and altar
- 2nd Maccabees a lot of good people that weren't 
significant figures like Judas Maccabeus, etc.
- What will the people who loved us remember about us? 
Will we be a good witness for Jesus?
- Sirach:
```
Though we speak much we cannot reach the end,
    and the sum of our words is: “He is the all.”
```
To know God is to know that you can't praise him enough
