### Fr Mike Summary
- God only makes good, but we can abuse that:
```
From the beginning good things were created for good people,
    just as evil things for sinners.
Basic to all the needs of manâ€™s life
    are water and fire and iron and salt
and wheat flour and milk and honey,
    the blood of the grape, and oil and clothing.
All these are for good to the godly,
    just as they turn into evils for sinners.
```
