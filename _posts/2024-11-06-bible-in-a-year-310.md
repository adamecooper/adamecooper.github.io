# The Bible in a Year Podcast: Day 310

### 2 Maccabees 13
- Antiochus Eupator was coming to Judaea with an army and Menelaus urged them 
on for his own selfish purposes
- Menelaus was justly put to death for his crimes
- Judas petitioned the people to pray to God for deliverance
- Judas rode out to face Antiochus and attacked their camp at night and were
victorious due to the protection of the Lord
- The king tried in vain to attack the Jews, but was defeated. The king made 
a treaty with the Jews and respected their temple.

### Wisdom 15-16
```
For to know thee is complete righteousness,
and to know thy power is the root of immortality.
```

On idolatry
```
With misspent toil, he forms a futile god from the same clay—
this man who was made of earth a short time before
and after a little while goes to the earth from which he was taken,
when he is required to return the soul that was lent him.
```

On the disordered love of money
```
But he considered our existence an idle game,
and life a festival held for profit,
for he says one must get money however one can, even by base means.
```

A type of Holy Communion
```
Instead of these things thou didst give thy people food of angels,
and without their toil thou didst supply them from heaven with bread ready to eat,
providing every pleasure and suited to every taste.

For thy sustenance manifested thy sweetness toward thy children;
and the bread, ministering to the desire of the one who took it,
was changed to suit every one’s liking.
```

"Man does not live on bread alone"
```
Therefore at that time also, changed into all forms,
it served thy all-nourishing bounty,
according to the desire of those who had need,
so that thy sons, whom thou didst love, O Lord, might learn
that it is not the production of crops that feeds man,
but that thy word preserves those who trust in thee.
```

### Proverbs 25:15-17
```
With patience a ruler may be persuaded,
    and a soft tongue will break a bone.

If you have found honey, eat only enough for you,
    lest you be sated with it and vomit it.
 
Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house,
    lest he become weary of you and hate you.
```

### Fr Mike Summary
- Pressure over time (patience) can accomplish great things
- Don't be a glutton. There is wisdom in knowing when enough 
is enough of a good thing.
- We don't make idols out of bad things. We take good things and
make them into ultimate things.
- You can identify your own idols by asking "who or what is God's
chief rival for my time and heart?"
- Our relationship with God doesn't tolerate rivals analogous to a 
marriage. If so, the relationship would not be healthy.
- Sports - e.g. not making it to Mass on Sunday due to a 
sports tournament.
