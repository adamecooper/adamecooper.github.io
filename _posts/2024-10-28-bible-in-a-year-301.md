### Proverbs 24:13-16
```
Know that wisdom is such to your soul;
    if you find it, there will be a future,
    and your hope will not be cut off.

Lie not in wait as a wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous;
    do not violence to his home;
for a righteous man falls seven times, and rises again;
    but the wicked are overthrown by calamity.
```


### Fr Mike Summary
- The Old Testament is revealed in the New Testament, and the 
New Testament is hidden in the old.
- Everyone is obtaining the high priesthood via bribery
- We learned more about the Greek customs related to the building
of the gymnasium.
- Jason set up the gymnasium to increasing the Hellenization of the 
young people so they'll abandon faith in the God of Israel. The people
doing this are connected to the temple; it's deep internal corruption 
of the religious figures. This explains the actions of Judas Maccabeus
and his brothers.
- Proverbs: "for a righteous man falls seven times, and rises again".
Even the righteous person falls seven times a day; what separates him
from the unrighteous is that he gets back up. God continues to pour out
his mercy and love.
