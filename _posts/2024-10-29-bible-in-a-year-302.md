# The Bible in a Year Podcast: Day 302

### 2 Maccabees 5
- Jason tried to retake the city of Jerusalem and killed his own citizens
in the process
- Jason failed to take the city, and went into exile where he died in disgrace
- The king thought that Judaea was in revolt, and so killed many people 
- Antiochus pillaged the temple. He was only able to do this because the city
as a whole was in such a state of sin.

```
But the Lord did not choose the nation for the sake of the holy place, but the 
place for the sake of the nation. Therefore the place itself shared in the 
misfortunes that befell the nation and afterward participated in its benefits; 
and what was forsaken in the wrath of the Almighty was restored again in all 
its glory when the great Lord became reconciled.
```

- Apollonius replaced Antiochus and started killing people for not working on 
the Sabbath. Judas Maccabaeus and companions escaped into the wilderness to 
avoid sharing in the defilement.

### Sirach 50-51
Sirach discusses Simon, the high priest, who rebuilt the temple. Sirach then 
blesses God and prays that he deliver the Jewish people, before closing the book
with an epilogue, prayer, and autobiographal poem on wisdom.

### Proverbs 24:17-20
```
Do not rejoice when your enemy falls,
    and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles;
 
lest the Lord see it, and be displeased,
    and turn away his anger from him.
 
Fret not yourself because of evildoers,
    and be not envious of the wicked;
 
for the evil man has no future;
    the lamp of the wicked will be put out.
````

### Fr Mike Summary
- The punishment of God in 2 Maccabees 5 is just and meant to reorient the 
Jewish people towards God.
- The most important takeaway from Sirach is that the pursuit of wisdom is
the way we're called to live and belong to God.
- Proverbs tells us that we have a temptation to enjoy other peoples'
misfortune (schadenfreude) because there is a brokenness in our hearts.
