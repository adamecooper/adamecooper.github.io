# The Bible in a Year Podcast: Day 303

### 2 Maccabees 6
- The king compelled the Jews to forsake Judaism and dedicate the temple to 
Greek Gods
- The Greeks desecrated the temple, prohibited Jews from practicing Judaism and 
persecuted and killed those who resisted
- The author of 2 Maccabees explains that this persecution was a way for God
to discipline the Jewish people for their impiety (i.e. it was a good thing).
- The Greeks tried to force Eleazar, a scribe, to eat pig and he refused. His 
friends in charge of persecuting him tried to get him to pretend to eat pig,
but he declined participating in the pretense and told them to kill him instead
of allowing him to disgrace himself

```
Yet whether I live or die I shall not escape the hands of the Almighty.
```

```
And those who a little before had acted toward him with good will now changed 
to ill will, because the words he had uttered were in their opinion sheer 
madness.
```
- Eleazar died with dignity and was an example of nobility and courage for his 
nation

### Wisdom 1-2
- "Love righteousness"

```
For a holy and disciplined spirit will flee from deceit,
and will rise and depart from foolish thoughts,
and will be ashamed at the approach of unrighteousness.
```

```
Beware then of useless murmuring,
and keep your tongue from slander;
because no secret word is without result,
and a lying mouth destroys the soul.
```

- "For he created all things that they might exist"
- Wisdom explains the ungodly worldview and how it is a product of reasoning 
unsoundly.
- Wisdom explains that this leads to hedonism and relativism: 
  - "Come, therefore, let us enjoy the good things that exist, and make use 
  of the creation to the full as in youth."
  - "But let our might be our law of right"
- People that reason unsoundly "did not know the secret purposes of God"

### Proverbs 24:21-26
- "Partiality in judging is not good."

### Fr Mike Summary
- To punish the Jewish people immediately is counterintuitively a great 
gift of God 
- The people trying to cut a deal with Eleazar are symbolic of the evil one.
Initially, they have good will towards him until he refuses to give in and 
they turn on him.
- Eleazar shows the importance of the sin of scandal. You can go to Hell for 
leading people into sin, and Eleazar refuses to do so.
- Wisdom: "God did not make death"
- "But ungodly men by their words and deeds summoned death". This is what we 
do. God doesn't want us to choose evil.
- Jesus is the fulfillment of Wisdom 2.

```
Let us lie in wait for the righteous man,
because he is inconvenient to us and opposes our actions;
he reproaches us for sins against the law,
and accuses us of sins against our training.
 
He professes to have knowledge of God,
and calls himself a child[f] of the Lord.
 
He became to us a reproof of our thoughts;
 
the very sight of him is a burden to us,
because his manner of life is unlike that of others,
and his ways are strange.

We are considered by him as something base,
and he avoids our ways as unclean;
he calls the last end of the righteous happy,
and boasts that God is his father.
 
Let us see if his words are true,
and let us test what will happen at the end of his life;
 
for if the righteous man is Godâ€™s son, he will help him,
and will deliver him from the hand of his adversaries.
 
Let us test him with insult and torture,
that we may find out how gentle he is,
and make trial of his forbearance.

Let us condemn him to a shameful death,
for, according to what he says, he will be protected.
```
