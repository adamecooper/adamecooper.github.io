# The Bible in a Year Podcast: Day 296

### 1st Maccabees 15
- King Antiochus, Demetrius' son, wrote a friendly letter to the Jews  
- King Antiouchus invaded the land of his fathers against Trypho
- When Rome got a letter and giant golden shield from the Jews, they wrote
to all the kings around the world to tell them to respect the Jews and hand
over any enemies that fled from Israel to Simon
- Antiochus turned against Simon, though it's unclear why, and sent his friend
Athenobius to give a hostile message to Simon. Simon responded that they had
not done anything wrong to Antiochus, but only took back what belonged to their
forefathers
- Trypho embarked to beseige Israel

### Sirach 36-37
- "Where there is no fence, the property will be plundered; and where there 
is no wife, a man will wander about and sigh."
- "Do not forget a friend in your heart, and be not unmindful of him in your 
wealth."
- "Every counselor praises counsel, but some give counsel in their own interest."
- "And establish the counsel of your own heart, for no one is more faithful to 
you than it is. For a man’s soul sometimes keeps him better informed than 
seven watchmen sitting high on a watchtower. And besides all this pray to the 
Most High that he may direct your way in truth."

### Proverbs 23:26-28


### Fr Mike Summary
 - "Every friend will say, “I too am a friend”; but some friends are friends only in name."
 - Don't consult with someone about X that has no wisdom about X
 - Learning your own heart is priceless. Where is my heart wise (so we know 
 to be led) vs where is my heart foolish (so we know where to be on guard)?
