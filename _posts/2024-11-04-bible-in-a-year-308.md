### 2 Maccabees 11
- Lysias besieges the Jews to make Judaea a vassal state
- An angel appeared to the Maccabeeans because they were faithful to the 
Lord and they defeated Lysias
- Lysias escaped, realized God was on the side of the Jews and made peace 
with the Jews
- King Antiochus restored the temple to the Jews and allowed them to live
by their own customs


### Wisdom 11-12 
- Discusses how Wisdom helped the Israelites in their 40 years in the desert
- God's punishments were for idolatry the ultimate good of the Jewish people

```
In return for their foolish and wicked thoughts,
which led them astray to worship irrational serpents and worthless animals,
thou didst send upon them a multitude of irrational creatures to punish them,
that they might learn that one is punished by the very things by which he sins.
```

```
For thou lovest all things that exist,
and hast loathing for none of the things which thou hast made,
for thou wouldst not have made anything if thou hadst hated it.
```

```
So while chastening us thou scourgest our enemies ten thousand times more,
so that we may meditate upon thy goodness when we judge,
and when we are judged we may expect mercy.
```

### Proverbs 25:8-10
```
Argue your case with your neighbor himself,
    and do not disclose anotherâ€™s secret;
lest he who hears you bring shame upon you,
    and your ill repute have no end.
```

### Fr Mike Summary
- God punishes us little by little to give us the chance to repent 
- Oftentimes, unbeknownst to us, God is witholding the serpents in the 
wilderness to protect us until we forsake him.
